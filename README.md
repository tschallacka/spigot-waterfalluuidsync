# WaterFall UUID Sync
A mostly uselss plugin, to experiment with bungeecord/waterfall messaging api.

When a player logs on to the server, it asks the bungeecord/waterfall server what the UUID is of the player, then logs the local UUID of the player and the Waterfall verified UUID of thep layer.

When bungeecord mode is enabled in spigot.yml then they should always match.
